## Vim Configuration

### Foundations

`.vimrc` and `init.vim` are both configuration files for the Vim text editor, but they have a difference in location and purpose.

- `.vimrc` is the traditional configuration file for Vim, and is usually stored in the user's home directory. It is used to configure Vim's settings, key bindings, plugins, etc. for a specific user on a specific system.
- `init.vim`, on the other hand, is the configuration file for Vim when used with the Neovim text editor. `init.vim` is located in a directory called `config` inside the Neovim configuration directory.

In summary, `.vimrc` is used for Vim configuration and `init.vim` is used for Neovim configuration.

**I use Vim 0.7.0.**

### Theme

* **Nord** theme for dark mode
* **One Half Light** theme for light mode

### Installing plugins
I use Vundle. Everytime you install a plugin in Vim, just add the plugin name inside the Bundle snippet.
After that just open Vim and run
```console
:PluginInstall
```
